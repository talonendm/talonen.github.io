# Face Tracking and Facial Recognition

Challenges
- [Wrongly Recognized](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html)
- [Too many mistakes?](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/facial-recognition-gives-police-powerful-new-tracking-tool-it-s-n894936)

## face tracking with p5
Lot of projects in Github, I decided to fork this repository: [face-tracking-p5js](https://github.com/stc/face-tracking-p5js) and now it is available at here: [face-tracking-p5js](https://github.com/talonendm/face-tracking-p5js.git).
And then in Bashm I wrote these commands:
~~~
cd git
git clone https://github.com/talonendm/face-tracking-p5js.git
~~~

and tested e.g. 002_points starting local server at: http://127.0.0.1:8887/002_points/


## Python - DLib
Similar package for Python is available, read more e.g. [here](https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-03-detecting-face-features-with-python/)
It seems that both libraries detect almost the same points:
- Jaw Points = 0–16
- Right Brow Points = 17–21
- Left Brow Points = 22–26
- Nose Points = 27–35
- Right Eye Points = 36–41
- Left Eye Points = 42–47
- Mouth Points = 48–60
- Lips Points = 61–67

Note that e.g. point 27 and 32 are irises in clmtracker, check image [here](https://livecodestream.dev/post/2020-07-12-detecting-face-features-and-applying-filters-with-javascript/).

# Face Substitution
[Face substitution](https://www.auduno.com/clmtrackr/examples/facesubstitution.html) where facemodel has fitted and try out different masks. More examples available at Auduno's Github [Repo](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr).

# Ideas to do
I already made first experiments in my forked repo, see [face-tracking-p5js](https://github.com/talonendm/face-tracking-p5js.git).
TODO:
- Combine points by lines and add additional points between the points like shown [here](https://rapidapi.com/blog/top-facial-recognition-apis/).
- Check ratios between points, e.g. eye distance divided by max(y) - min(y), some ideas available here [IBM Research Releases ‘Diversity in Faces’ Dataset to Advance Study of Fairness in Facial Recognition Systems](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/01/diversity-in-faces/).

# Text to Speech

Code example to convert Finnish text to speech ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CHV33wDsI)) (original code by [Hao](https://editor.p5js.org/hao/sketches/8OhA3cn1J)) and updated code in [p5 editor ](https://editor.p5js.org/haques/sketches/RNPHiXmE2):

In local experiments, you need [p5.js speech library](https://github.com/IDMNYU/p5.js-speech) or use from CDN as

~~~
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/IDMNYU/p5.js-speech@0.0.3/lib/p5.speech.js"></script>
~~~





~~~

let speech;

var speaking = false;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(600, 800);
  speech = new p5.Speech(voiceReady); //callback, speech
  speech.started(startSpeaking);
  background(0);

  // shiffman has these inside setup:

  function startSpeaking() {
    background(0,255,0);
    speaking = true;
  }

  function endSpeaking() {
    background(255, 0, 0);
    speaking = false;
  }




}



function voiceReady() {
  // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CHV33wDsI
  console.log(speech.voices);
}

function mousePressed() {
  // speech.setVoice('SpeechSynthesisVoice');
  speech.setVoice('Microsoft Heidi - Finnish (Finland)');

  // 3 things can be changed: rate, pitch and volume
  // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0CHV33wDsI
  speech.setVolume(0.7);
  speech.setRate(2);
  speech.setPitch(0.2);

  speech.speak('aluskate tulee asentaa siten että vesi valuu ulkoseinälinjan ulkopuolelle'); // say something
}
  
function draw() {
  fill(120,100,200);
  //print(frameCount);
  if (speaking) text(frameCount,40,40);
  
  if (frameCount == 100) {
    speech.setVoice('Microsoft Heidi - Finnish (Finland)');



    speech.speak('aluskate juu juu');
  }
  // speaking = false;
}
