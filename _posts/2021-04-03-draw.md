In this post, it is discussed about drawing application available in this [repo](https://github.com/talonendm/draw-java). [Processing](https://processing.org/) is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Original dawing application for Android (DinoDraw) was coded in the beginning of 2010s. I used ANT to geneate an apk file, but I was not able to find apk file anymore. I guess it isn't supported anymore, see my discussion [here](https://talonendm.github.io/2020-11-29-apk/). 

However, source code is now available in [draw-java](https://github.com/talonendm/draw-java) repository. I have made new changes and started new project called PentingDraw.

~~~
cd git # or wherever you have your repositories
git clone https://github.com/talonendm/draw-java.git
cd draw-java
mkdir DinoDraw2
cp C:/Users/talon_000/OneDrive/TiedostotMore/DinoDraw2/* DinoDraw2/
# OR/AND
cp -r C:/Users/talon_000/Documents/Processing/PentingDraw . # comment: recursively copying
~~~

Note that while copying, some permissions were denied, follow these [instructions](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/73838/cp-permission-denied-when-copy-a-file-owned-by-root/73842). I decided to copy rest of the files manually. Powershell [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2997578/how-do-i-comment-on-the-windows-command-line), copy [recursively](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/103031/cp-all-files-and-subdirectories-in-a-directory-ksh).

# Penting keys

- b/B: decrease/increase pen radius by one pixel
- g: show/hide palette on top
- n,N,3: new frame
- l: laser on/off (on animated pics - it is not shown?)
- o: center picture (update by r)
- r: refresh image
- 8/9: scale image
- a/A: animate drawing while making your drawing
- v: undo last line
- u: undo first line
- S: save image as csv
- s: save image as png
- -/+: max pen size on pressure
- t: redraw background image
- ESC: save png and exit  


# Drawing application ideas

## Create class viiva or piste
Class viiva having properties for the line. Note that if point, then connections should be stored different way. Save by 'S' key. Stored csv files can be visualied with p5 script, which makes it possible to animate drawings, see e.g. [Katakana](https://talonendm.github.io/katakana/).

### Edits before saving
Scaling '8' and '9' and centering of the object 'o'. Refresh image 'r'

## Features
Background image/art/painting to help sketching. Similarly as it was in DinoDraw2 application.

# P5
Random numbers added to the drawings. Also smoothing could be added. Drawing game, first experiment also available in [Katakana](https://talonendm.github.io/katakana/) where drawing should be followed by finger or mouse.

## Todo P5
- in mobile app, easily navigate by letters and in p5 webpage, with keyboard find e.g. all letters containing "a"
- easier to find letters, e.g. if reading paper book


# TODO draw
- Store video frames and remove possible background image from final movie file.
- webcam: draw yourself (mirrow and moving)
- on / off: show one pixes for place: lines through pixels


# GIMP

## Huion 430P and Windows 11

I thought that my cheap tablet doesn't work anymore. I need to make some installation and setup:

Install [Driver](https://www.huion.com/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=lists&catid=16&down_title2=H430P), otherwise a tablet works only with some delay. (Driver_15.4.1.3542   021-09-11)

## Compressing Images

- PNG to jpeg, quality after selecting ``export as''.
