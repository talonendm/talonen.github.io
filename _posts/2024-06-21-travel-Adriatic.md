# Helsinki-Vantaa airport

Traveling from Helsinki to Dubrovnik was made much easier by pre-booking parking at the airport. We chose to reserve a spot in either the P3 or P4 parking areas in advance, which proved to be a smart move. It is possible to make reservation at [Finavia](https://www.finavia.fi/fi/lentoasemat/helsinki-vantaa/pysakointi?navref=paragraph), I think 77 euros for 8 days was erasonable price at P3. The convenience of being able to drive straight into the parking hall without any hassle made the start of our journey stress-free. Although we encountered a minor issue with the license plate recognition system not working when we were leaving, the overall experience was still positive and it simplified our trip considerably.

One noteworthy tip is to make sure your refrigerator is empty before you leave, so you don't come back to spoiled food. Upon our return, after collecting our luggage, we discovered the Alepa 24h convenience store right at the airport. This was incredibly handy for grabbing some essentials before heading home, ensuring we had everything we needed without an extra stop.

# Dubrovnik

Dubrovnik is a popular tourist destination in Croatia, known for its historic Old Town and beautiful Adriatic coastline. For families with children, Dubrovnik offers a variety of activities such as relaxing on the beach, boat trips, and exploring historical sites. The Old Town is especially charming with its narrow streets and city walls, providing a sense of stepping back in time. [Google maps ta.dm](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dubrovnik,+Kroatia/@42.6476756,18.090904,15.25z)

The impact of war on Dubrovnik was significant. During the Yugoslav Wars, particularly between 1991 and 1992, Dubrovnik suffered from bombings and battles that damaged many historic buildings and infrastructure. The city's walls, churches, and palaces were damaged, and parts of the city were under siege for months. However, after the war, Dubrovnik underwent extensive restoration and today it thrives once again as a major tourist destination. The scars of the war are mainly visible in museums and historical exhibits.

Dubrovnik is also known for having experienced a significant earthquake in its history. The most devastating earthquake struck on April 6, 1667, causing extensive damage to the city. This earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 7.4, resulted in the deaths of around 5,000 people and destroyed many buildings, including numerous historical structures.

[Ragusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ragusa) was the former name of Dubrovnik. Ragusa was a significant maritime and trading city on the Adriatic coast. It was founded in the 7th century, likely by Roman refugees fleeing barbarian invasions. The city grew into a powerful and wealthy republic known as the Republic of Ragusa. It thrived on trade, establishing diplomatic and commercial relations with many Mediterranean and European countries. Ragusa was renowned for its skilled diplomacy, maintaining independence and neutrality amidst larger powers. The city's architecture and culture flourished, leaving a rich historical legacy. In the early 20th century, the name was officially changed to Dubrovnik. Today, Dubrovnik retains its historic charm, attracting visitors from around the world. The legacy of Ragusa is still evident in Dubrovnik's well-preserved medieval walls and buildings.

## Lapad

Early in the morning, I embarked on a serene journey from Babin Kuk to Lapad, seeking tranquility and adventure in the early hours.

My day began with a peaceful bus ride, whisking me swiftly from Babin Kuk to Lapad. As I arrived in the quiet morning hours, the streets were just beginning to stir awake. The crisp air and gentle sunrise cast a tranquil ambiance over my surroundings, perfect for an early morning walk and jog.

I set off towards the Lapad Battery ([Google maps - New Battery Lapad Ul. Iva Dulčića 142, 20000, Dubrovnik, Kroatia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qzhWyVHpdC7iJLmr5)), immersing myself in the natural beauty and historic charm of the area. The pathway was serene, lined with lush greenery and dotted with glimpses of the azure Adriatic Sea. The Lapad Battery itself, steeped in history and offering panoramic views, was a perfect spot to reflect and appreciate the beauty of Dubrovnik's coastline.

After my contemplative stroll, I ventured towards Copacabana Beach, where I arrived just as it opened at 9 a.m. Designed to cater to tourists, the beach greeted me with pristine sands and inviting waters, perfect for a refreshing dip in the early morning light.

Continuing my journey, I made my way towards Sunset Beach, stopping along the way to explore the stunning rocky coastline near the Royal Hotels & Resort Dubrovnik. Here, I indulged in some snorkeling, mesmerized by the underwater world thriving beneath the clear Adriatic waters.

Stopping briefly at Hotel Dubrovnik for a quick restroom break, I appreciated the calm ambiance of the surroundings before continuing on my way. From there, I decided to climb [Vrh Velike Petke](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g295371-d10543788-Reviews-Velika_Petka_Hill-Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html), a hill known for its stunning views of Dubrovnik and the Adriatic coastline. From Vrh Velike Petke, I decided to jog back towards the city. As I made my way, enjoying the downhill stretch and the refreshing morning breeze, I unexpectedly encountered a tortoise on my path near the hospital.

The tortoise, seemingly unfazed by the morning rush (unlike me), was leisurely making its way across the pavement. It was a charming and unexpected sight, contrasting with the bustling human activity around the hospital. Stopping for a moment to admire this unexpected encounter with nature, I gently guided the tortoise off the path to a safer spot nearby. It was a delightful pause in my morning jog, a reminder to appreciate the small wonders that cross our paths unexpectedly.

The ascent was invigorating, with the scent of pine trees and the sound of birdsong filling the air. Upon reaching the summit of Vrh Velike Petke, I was rewarded with panoramic vistas that stretched across the sea and the historic city below. It was a peaceful and contemplative moment, offering a unique perspective of Dubrovnik in the early morning light.

## Perfect place for last day

Our final day in Cavtat was bittersweet, filled with moments of reflection and anticipation for the journey ahead. We checked out of our Airbnb at 10 a.m., the warm sun already promising another beautiful day. Our bags packed and ready, we called an Uber to take us to our next destination for the day. The ride cost 25 euros, and soon we found ourselves navigating the charming streets of Cavtat one last time.

Since our flight was scheduled for the evening, we had plenty of time to soak in the sights and sounds of this lovely seaside town. First, we needed a place to store our luggage, so we headed to a local luggage store. For just 5 euros per bag, we secured our belongings, allowing us to wander freely without the burden of heavy suitcases.

With the rest of the day at our disposal, we set out to explore Cavtat at a leisurely pace. The town's picturesque streets, lined with historic buildings and vibrant flowers, offered countless opportunities for delightful discoveries. We wandered along the waterfront promenade, the gentle lapping of the waves providing a soothing soundtrack to our stroll. The azure waters of the Adriatic Sea sparkled under the midday sun, creating a mesmerizing view that we tried to imprint in our minds.

After lunch, I walkeds stairs up and visited surroundings near the Racic Mausoleum ([private sp](https://www.sports-tracker.com/workout/haques/668557405644c8040b80f178)), a peaceful spot with stunning views over the sea and the town. The serenity of the place was a perfect counterpoint to the bustling marina below, and we spent a few quiet moments appreciating the beauty and history surrounding us. On my way, we walked past the statue of [Frano Supilo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frano_Supilo), a notable Croatian politician and journalist known for his efforts in promoting Croatian autonomy and unity in the early 20th century. The statue stood as a reminder of his significant contributions to the country’s history and his enduring legacy in the region.

The afternoon slipped away as we continued our explorations, stopping occasionally to rest on a bench or grab a refreshing gelato. Every corner of Cavtat seemed to hold a new surprise, and we relished every moment of our final hours here.

As evening approached, we retrieved our luggage and made our way to the airport, ready to embark on the next leg of our journey. The goodbye to Cavtat was filled with a mix of emotions – sadness to leave such a beautiful place, but also gratitude for the memories we created.

Our last day in Cavtat was a perfect blend of relaxation and exploration, a fitting end to a fantastic trip. As we boarded our flight, we carried with us the essence of this charming town, promising ourselves that we would return one day to relive the magic.

## Lokrum

The first written mention of Lokrum dates back to 1023 when a Benedictine monastery was founded on the island. Legend has it that Richard the Lionheart was shipwrecked on Lokrum in 1192 upon returning from the Crusades and vowed to build a church there, but ultimately agreed to have it built in the city of Dubrovnik.

Lokrumin ensimmäinen kirjallinen maininta on peräisin vuodesta 1023, kun benediktiiniluostari perustettiin saarelle. Richard Leijonamielen väitetään joutuneen haaksirikkoon Lokrumille vuonna 1192 ristiretkiltä palattuaan ja luvanneen rakentaa kirkon sinne, mutta lopulta suostui rakennuttamaan sen Dubrovnikin kaupunkiin. [lokru.hr](https://www.lokrum.hr/eng/)

Lokrum offers a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of Dubrovnik, especially in the central part of the island, where old, winding olive trees create an atmosphere full of peace and quiet.

Lokrum tarjoaa rauhallisen pakopaikan Dubrovnikin vilinästä, erityisesti saaren keskiosassa, missä vanhat oliivipuut luovat tunnelman täynnä rauhaa ja hiljaisuutta [unermatrippi.fi](https://www.unelmatrippi.fi/lokrum-saaritauko-dubrovnikin-halinasta/)




## Elafiti

Elafiti, or the Elaphiti Islands, are a small archipelago situated near Dubrovnik, Croatia. The main islands in the Elafiti group are Šipan, Lopud, and Koločep. Each of these islands offers unique attractions and a serene atmosphere. The islands are known for their beautiful beaches, such as Šunj Beach on Lopud, which is famous for its sandy shore and clear waters.

### Lopud

Our family had a truly unforgettable day on Lopud Island, blessed with full sunshine from dawn to dusk. We started our adventure early, catching the 10 a.m. Jadrolinija ferry. The crisp morning air and sparkling sea set the perfect tone as we sailed towards Lopud, the excitement building with every passing wave.

Our destination for the day was the famous Šunj Beach, renowned for its golden sands and shallow, warm waters. To reach it, we had early lunch with refressing beers at [Hotel Glavovic](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g608713-d669824-Reviews-Hotel_Glavovic-Lopud_Dubrovnik_Dubrovnik_Neretva_County_Dalmatia.html) terrace. Pretty good pizzas - and we actually had also dinner in that same place. Two of us embarked on a scenic walk through lush, aromatic pine forests, the sound of cicadas accompanying our steps. The trail was an adventure in itself, with the promise of a beautiful beach waiting at the end. Two of us decided to take a golf cart ride to the beach (3 euro / person), which turned out to be a fun and convenient way to enjoy the scenery without the long walk. 

Šunj Beach did not disappoint. Its wide, sandy expanse and gentle waves made it the perfect spot for a family day out. The kids dashed straight into the water, their laughter echoing as they splashed and played. We set up our little camp with beach towels and a parasol, and soon joined them, the crystal-clear Adriatic Sea inviting us in.

We spent hours swimming, floating, and playing games in the water. The beach’s shallow waters were ideal for the kids, allowing them to safely enjoy themselves while we relaxed nearby. We built sandcastles together, collecting shells and pebbles to decorate our creations. The warm sun overhead and the soft sand beneath our feet made it easy to lose track of time.

As the afternoon progressed, we decided to explore the surrounding area. A short walk took us to some rocky outcrops, perfect for a bit of amateur snorkeling. The underwater world was mesmerizing, with colorful fish darting about the coral and seaweed. The kids were fascinated, their eyes wide with wonder as they peeked through their goggles.

Before we knew it, the sun began its descent, casting a golden glow over the beach. We reluctantly packed up our things, taking one last dip in the sea before heading back. The walk back to the village was filled with chatter about the day’s adventures, the kids already asking when we could return.

We caught the 18:45 ferry back, the sunset painting the sky in hues of pink and orange. As we sailed away, we looked back at Lopud, a perfect little slice of paradise. Tired but happy, we made our way home, each of us carrying the memory of a perfect family day on Šunj Beach, promising ourselves to come back soon. Our walk: [private sp](https://www.sports-tracker.com/workout/haques/6682c8b024bbdd43402a6560)

Upon reaching Dubrovnik, we made a quick stop at a local supermarket (Studenac) in Grad to pick up some fresh groceries. With our bags in hand, we called an Uber to take us back to our Airbnb. The ride was comfortable and quick, and soon we were back in our cozy home-away-from-home.

We ended the day by enjoying the sunset from our balcony, the sky ablaze with colors as the sun dipped below the horizon. It was the perfect ending to a perfect day, filled with laughter, adventure, and the simple joys of being together.
