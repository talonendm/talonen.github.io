# Dubrovnik

Dubrovnik is a popular tourist destination in Croatia, known for its historic Old Town and beautiful Adriatic coastline. For families with children, Dubrovnik offers a variety of activities such as relaxing on the beach, boat trips, and exploring historical sites. The Old Town is especially charming with its narrow streets and city walls, providing a sense of stepping back in time. [Google maps ta.dm](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dubrovnik,+Kroatia/@42.6476756,18.090904,15.25z)

The impact of war on Dubrovnik was significant. During the Yugoslav Wars, particularly between 1991 and 1992, Dubrovnik suffered from bombings and battles that damaged many historic buildings and infrastructure. The city's walls, churches, and palaces were damaged, and parts of the city were under siege for months. However, after the war, Dubrovnik underwent extensive restoration and today it thrives once again as a major tourist destination. The scars of the war are mainly visible in museums and historical exhibits.

Dubrovnik is also known for having experienced a significant earthquake in its history. The most devastating earthquake struck on April 6, 1667, causing extensive damage to the city. This earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 7.4, resulted in the deaths of around 5,000 people and destroyed many buildings, including numerous historical structures.

[Ragusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ragusa) was the former name of Dubrovnik. Ragusa was a significant maritime and trading city on the Adriatic coast. It was founded in the 7th century, likely by Roman refugees fleeing barbarian invasions. The city grew into a powerful and wealthy republic known as the Republic of Ragusa. It thrived on trade, establishing diplomatic and commercial relations with many Mediterranean and European countries. Ragusa was renowned for its skilled diplomacy, maintaining independence and neutrality amidst larger powers. The city's architecture and culture flourished, leaving a rich historical legacy. In the early 20th century, the name was officially changed to Dubrovnik. Today, Dubrovnik retains its historic charm, attracting visitors from around the world. The legacy of Ragusa is still evident in Dubrovnik's well-preserved medieval walls and buildings.

## Lokrum

The first written mention of Lokrum dates back to 1023 when a Benedictine monastery was founded on the island. Legend has it that Richard the Lionheart was shipwrecked on Lokrum in 1192 upon returning from the Crusades and vowed to build a church there, but ultimately agreed to have it built in the city of Dubrovnik.

Lokrumin ensimmäinen kirjallinen maininta on peräisin vuodesta 1023, kun benediktiiniluostari perustettiin saarelle. Richard Leijonamielen väitetään joutuneen haaksirikkoon Lokrumille vuonna 1192 ristiretkiltä palattuaan ja luvanneen rakentaa kirkon sinne, mutta lopulta suostui rakennuttamaan sen Dubrovnikin kaupunkiin. [lokru.hr](https://www.lokrum.hr/eng/)

Lokrum offers a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of Dubrovnik, especially in the central part of the island, where old, winding olive trees create an atmosphere full of peace and quiet.

Lokrum tarjoaa rauhallisen pakopaikan Dubrovnikin vilinästä, erityisesti saaren keskiosassa, missä vanhat oliivipuut luovat tunnelman täynnä rauhaa ja hiljaisuutta [unermatrippi.fi](https://www.unelmatrippi.fi/lokrum-saaritauko-dubrovnikin-halinasta/)
