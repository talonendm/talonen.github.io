From rome to Florence

Taking the E80 highway along the coast instead of the A1 offers a different kind of road trip experience, with stunning Mediterranean views and the charm of coastal Italy. Here's what you can expect when driving from Rome to Florence via the E80:

The E80, also known as the Autostrada A12, runs parallel to Italy's Tyrrhenian Sea coastline. While it adds time to the journey (approximately 4–5 hours compared to 3 hours on the A1), the scenic route offers breathtaking views, coastal towns, and a more relaxed driving experience.

# Civitavecchia

Just an hour outside Rome, this port city is a major hub for cruise ships. While it’s not a major tourist destination, it’s a good spot to take a break and enjoy fresh seafood or a stroll along the marina.

# Maremma Region (Tuscany):

As you enter Tuscany, the E80 takes you through the [Maremma](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wJhW9A6EhQuuWfa46), a beautiful and lesser-known area characterized by sandy beaches, pine forests, and nature reserves. Consider stopping at:

# On way to Florence

- [Tarquinia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WoWtCr776JuzY1Ke9): Famous for its Etruscan necropolis and medieval architecture.
- [Orbetello Lagoon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5tWD9gPzjsiW1Qb26): A stunning coastal area with scenic views and opportunities for birdwatching.
- [Grosseto](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wQY99gCKUxHuKXoy6): The capital of the Maremma region, Grosseto is a quaint town with medieval walls and a charming old center. It's a nice detour for a quick meal or walk.
- [Pisa or Livorno](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZiZHoi1f6zXQNYA67) (Optional Detour): If **you have extra time**, a detour to Pisa for its iconic Leaning Tower or Livorno for its canals and seafood is well worth it.
- Tuscan Countryside: After leaving the coast, you'll turn inland toward Florence. This part of the drive takes you through vineyards, olive groves, and hilltop villages, offering a quintessential Tuscan experience.

# Florence

- Visit the Galileo Museum: 
  - Location: Piazza dei Giudici, Florence
  - This museum is a must for anyone interested in Galileo’s life and scientific achievements. You can see Galileo’s finger (part of his remains), telescopes, and other historical scientific instruments.
- Climb the Duomo for Stunning Views
  - Galileo is famously linked to the Duomo because of his experiments with the pendulum and the tower’s clock mechanism.
