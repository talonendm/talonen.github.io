## Word cloud - Thesis: Advances in Methods of Anomaly Detection and Visualization of Multivariate Data
Thesis published already in year 2015 and this word cloud app was created few months later.

Test simple R shiny application running in shinyapps: [Thesis word cloud](https://talonen.shinyapps.io/thesis_wordcloud/ "shiny app")

Surprise, the most common word is "data" and thus having the largest font size.
