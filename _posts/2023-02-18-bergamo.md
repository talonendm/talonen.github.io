> Light is life at Bergamo, can't you feel the vibe?
It's the energy that keeps us moving, it's the rhythm of the tribe
From the sun up in the sky, to the streetlights on the road
Light is life at Bergamo, it's the essence of our soul

> Take a walk through the streets, feel the sunshine on your face
See the colors come alive, in this beautiful place
From the piazzas to the hills, every corner's a delight
Light is life at Bergamo, it's the fuel that ignites

As they descended from the tower, they stumbled upon the Trattoria Parietti, only to discover that it was closed. Undeterred, they continued their journey and stumbled upon the charming village of Valbona, where they discovered the excellent Maggese restaurant. The travelers feasted on delectable Italian cuisine and shared stories about Pokemons.

As the sun began to set, the town was transformed into a magical wonderland, as the buildings and monuments were illuminated with a stunning light show. The travelers marveled at the spectacular display, which was like nothing they had ever seen before.
