## Travelling

Most of my travel diary notes / logbooks are complete mess and even rather "stupid" notes. How many drinks, the cost of dinner, taxi etc. i.e. data. Other type of notes are how to travel next time. Notes to simulate Black Jack cards and odd calculation having one deck - just for fun not for beating the bank. "Our personalities were long thought to be fixed by the time we reach our 30s, but the latest research suggests they change throughout our lives – and bring some surprising benefits."
